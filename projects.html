    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h5>NetSuite</h5>
    <p>I supported a major migration project from custom systems to NetSuite ERP. I assisted with importing and transforming customer
         data as well as extensive testing. Currently, Iâ€™m leading as the key admin, working on adjusting user roles and permissions. I also have helped the finance team with processing sales orders and invoices.

    <h5>Onboarding & Offboarding</h5>
        <p>Both the onboarding and offboarding processes were almost nonexistent so I spent a lot of my time implementing 
        a new and improved system. Both processes utilise automation through Power Automate and integrate with Microsoft Form, 
        Freshdesk, Email and Teams.</p>
        <h6>Onboarding</h6>
            <p>The hiring manager submits a Microsoft form, triggering an automated Power Automate flow. The flow then alerts IT 
            (in Freshdesk) to create an email account for the new user. Simultaneously, the flow searches repeatedly through 
            Office 365 Admin Centre until it locates the new user account. Once the account is found tickets are created in 
            Freshdesk to alert specific IT team members to create new accounts for the new employee. Throughout this process, 
            both HR & the manager are kept in the loop (through automation) in Teams & Outlook.</p>
        <h6>Offboarding</h6>
        <p>The offboarding automation has a very similar path to onboarding automation. It also involves a Microsoft form, triggering 
            a range of Freshdesk tickets which are auto-allocated. It also sends out emails to both HR & the manager to keep them updated 
            with the process.</p>
